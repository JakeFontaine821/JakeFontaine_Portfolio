                    <h1>Hello!</h1>
                    <h2>My name is Jake Fontaine</h2>
                    <p class="big">I'm from Massachusetts and received my bachelor's degree in Game Development and Simulation Programming from the New England Institute of Technology. During my degree I realized my enjoyment didn't fall in making games, but software engineering and programming. Through individual practice I've gained experience with front-end web development and Python for different projects. I am passionate and driven to learn and experience.
                        <br><br>
                    Outside of programming I enjoy being active, playing basketball and golf as well as working out. I believe staying active helps me be a better programmer because stepping away and clearing my head has helped solved problems numerous times.
